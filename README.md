## Purpose

Prediction churn is the divergence in predictions made by a machine learning model after it has been retrained on new data. Churn needs to be minimized in order to keep model predictions more consistent for smooth operation of downstream tasks. Reduced churn also allows better insight into model performance and model behavior. 

It will also enable us determine how to design a new algorithm based on past deficiencies identified in our literature review. We will also learn how to write industry-standard code in the development of the churn reduction package.
