# Proofpoint

## Purpose

Our project's goal is to develop a novel prediction churn reduction method. Prediction churn is the divergence in predictions made by a machine learning model after it has been retrained on new data. Churn needs to be minimized in order to keep model predictions more consistent for smooth operation of downstream tasks. Reduced churn also allows better insight into model performance and model behavior. Our results will also be made available to the client and the broader public through an open-source package.

We will gain a strong understanding of the weaknesses and areas for improvement in the existing prediction churn literature. It will also enable us in determining how to design a new algorithm based on past deficiencies identified in our literature review. We will also learn how to write industry-standard code in the development of the churn reduction package.
